# API Testing on TronaldDump using RestAssured

## API Link
https://www.tronalddump.io/
## Project Aim
To test the endpoints of the api and access at least one piece of data in order to check working condition
of the API. In addition to this, as the API has front end interactions I have incorporated the use of 
Automation testing using Selenium in order to compare the results of both back end API response and the data
that is listed on the front end.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the tests within APITest.java
